     <h3>IRON MAN </h3>
        <a href="www.google.com">GOOGLE</a>

        <p>Since that first suit built in a cave, Tony has created dozens of new suits and 
        upgrades over the years. 
        However, throughout the 50-plus Iron Man models, 
        there are common offensive and defense capabilities found in most iterations.
        
        The primary weapon contained within every suit, the repulsor rays use energy pulses 
        to repel and disrupt enemies and are generated through the suit’s gauntlets. The suit’s 
        booster jets enable Stark to fly fast enough to break the sound barrier, and maneuver 
        more quickly than any fighter jet.
        
        Iron Man’s helmet provides Tony with a heads-up display that gives him 360-degree 
        vision, access to information about his surroundings and enemies, and the ability to 
        transmit and block transmissions along any frequency. The helmet also gives Tony a 
        degree of resistance to EMP and psychic-based attacks.</p>
